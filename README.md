# 🐛 AI-Based Pest Detection in Agriculture 🌱

This project presents an **intelligent pest management system** powered by **Artificial Intelligence** to detect and classify pests in crop fields using image recognition. The system is designed to provide **real-time pest detection** and suggest **actionable pest control measures**, helping farmers protect crops efficiently and sustainably.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional pest detection in agriculture is often **manual**, **time-consuming**, and **reactive**, resulting in delayed treatment, crop loss, and overuse of pesticides. There's a need for a **smart, fast, and scalable** solution that empowers farmers to take preventive measures in time.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a **web-based AI system** that:
- Detects pests from images of crops using a deep learning model.
- Classifies whether the detected organism is a pest or not.
- Suggests pest control advice based on the detected species.
- Works without requiring any specialized hardware.

## 🧠 AI & ML Approach

- ✅ **Model Type**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- ✅ **Pretrained Backbone**: ResNet (Transfer Learning)
- ✅ **Optimizer**: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- ✅ **Dataset**: Pest Image Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- ✅ **Training**: Fine-tuned for pest identification accuracy
